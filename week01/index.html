    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>
        This lesson was pretty much just a review for me. I feel like it was a lot of stuff I already know.
        I did like the videos because they pointed things out that were a great reminder or something new to ponder.
        Before switching my major to web design, I never realized how much thought goes into design, placement, etc. 
        I never thought about the way that I hold my phone and why that matters to developers. I also thought it was 
        interesting that a lot of people don't know what a hamburger menu is. These videos will definitely help me as 
        I am building websites and apps in my classes. 
        <br><br>
        Sometimes I struggle to start small. In the video, he talks about starting with the mobile screen and working 
        your way up. I like to tackle the harder things first because I feel like it will take the longest. I have been
        learning that that is not always the case when it comes to web design and development.
