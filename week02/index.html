    <p>Javascript basics, arrays, and functions</p>

    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>
        Javascript has two types of comments. Single line // and multi line /* */.
        It's important to make comments in your code even if you understand exactly
        what you are doing while your writing it. It helps to improve the readability
        from others and allows you to understand your thought process if you go back over
        it. It can also be helpful if your program encounters any issues. This is something
        that I can be better at.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are certain words that can't be used for variable and function names. These are nknown as 
        reserved words. Examples include: abstract, boolean, break, case, class, const, etc. <br><br>
        Just like coding in python, you have declare varibles before you can use them. Otherwise the program
        won't recognize them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Const and let are better practice and var should be used less often. According the the reading, "Using
        const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists inside the 
        block they are declared in." Be descriptive in the names you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arrays are declared using []. Example: const arrayName = []. You can insert things into an array like so:
        const flowers = ['Roses', 'Tulips', 'Daisy', 'Daffodil']. The first item in the array will be equal to zero.
        You can delete items from an array like so: delete flowers[2];. This will delete 'Daisy' from the array. To 
        remove the last item from the list you can use .pop().
    </p>
    <p>
        To define a function you say: function functionName(){ Here you insert the code for the function }
    </p>
