        * I've never actually used "this" before. I think it would be fun to practice using it in my homework for other classes. <br>
        * You can use "this" as an object within a method. <br>
        * Arrow functions don't have "this" <br>
        <br>
        <div class="example">
            <p>
                Example: <br>
                &emsp; let user = { <br>
                    &emsp; &emsp; name: "John", <br>
                    &emsp; &emsp; age: 30, <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; sayHi() { <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; alert(this.name);  //You could have also put user.name and it would have worked <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; } <br>
            &emsp; }; <br>

            user.sayHi();
            </p>
            
        </div>

        I don't think I have ever heard about ES6 until this week. I am pretty new to programming. I did some reading up on it to learn more (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp). I have definitely used a lot of its features without realizing it. <br> <br>
        You can access properties using dot notation (superman.name) response = 'Superman'. I've always found this to be super convenient. I also thought it was helpful to learn about the different math methhods because I haven't done a whole lot of math in Javascript yet.

    <p> I did the activity in the chapter title, "The Document Object Model." <a href="heroes.html">Link to Hero Activity</a></p>
    <p> I've done a few things with event listeners but not for a very long time. This reading was a really good refresher and I think it did a better job explaining the concept than my previous exposure. I had never used a 'dblclick' option for event listeners before. I found that to be really cool.</p>
    <h4>Questions:</h4>
    <p>I didn't have any questions this week. I felt like everything was pretty straightforward.</p> <br> <br>
