    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>
        Here is the <a href="activity.html">link</a> to this week's coding activity. <br>
        I've learned a lot about forms in the last couple of months. I love how easy they are to create
        and how many options you have for customizing them.

        The second reading about object oriented programming was a great review for me. Last semester I took the course <i>programming with classes</i> and it went over all of these principles.
        I really liked how simple these definitions were. It was also cool for me to see how these same principles related to javascript because I learned them using python.

        I had never heard of jQuery before. I think I may have used it before and just didn't know the name for it. Some of the stuff like the "$" and "_" were not new for me. I also was not aware that each module has it's own
        global scope. I thought that was pretty cool. It makes sense because python has global variables. I guess I've just never really payed attention to it while I've programmed. 
    </p>
    <h4>Questions:</h4>
    <p>
        I don't have any questions about the readings or assignments this week. I did learn a lot and enjoyed learning more about building forms.
