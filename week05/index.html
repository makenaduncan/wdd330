    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>
        Testing and debugging has always been a weakness for me. I'm not very good at it. I had someone walk me through it once and I completely understood it. The problem is that I never
        practiced it after that. I have definitely benefited from the built in VS Code warnings. It's so easy to forget the basics (e.g. a closing parenthese or quotation). 
        I will definitely be trying the strict mode feature out to see if it works with my programs.

        I like that the chapter went over test-driven code. This is an area that I would like to improve. I think that it can be very helpful and it helps to track what you've tried and if it works. I knew about the 
        console.log test but I don't use the function test method very much. I should probably get more familiar with that one. Another new thing I learned about is using alers to debug or console.trace and debugger. I also enjoyed learning about all of the different tools out there. I am clueless when it comes to this 
        kind of stuff and so I really appreciated learning about these. I am going to look into some of them further and test them out.

        I don't have any questions about the readings or assignments this week. I did learn a lot and enjoyed learning more about building forms.
