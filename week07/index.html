    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>
        I learned a lot of new things from the reading this week. I don't know that i've ever used the .cache property. If I have, I don't remember. I found that one
        pretty interesting. I included the example from the reading below so that I can remember it. The cache 
        object is used to store things (like results).
        <div class="example">
            Example: <br><br>
            function square(x){ <br>
                &emsp;    square.cache = square.cache || {}; <br>
                &emsp;    if (!square.cache[x]) { <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;        square.cache[x] = x*x; <br>
                    &emsp;    } <br>
                    &emsp;    return square.cache[x]<br>
            }
        </div>
        Another function I learned about is IIFE. This is the one where you add parentheses immediately after a <em>function definition</em>.
        Included with the IIFE function is temporary variables. I found this concept to be fascinating. It makes sense to include it because it
        helps to prevent certain errors.
        <div class="example">
            Example: <br><br>
            (function(){ <br>
                const temp = 'World'; <br>
                console.log(`Hello ${temp}`); <br>
                })<b>()</b>; &emsp;//This is where the parentheses were added<br>  
                << 'Hello World'
        </div>
        This reading helped me to see more ways that I can make my code efficient. I've always struggled to understand Javascript but I think 
        I'm beginning to understand it a lot better. I think I'm going to find some old assignments and see where I can implement some of the new 
        functions I learned about this week.

        I don't have any questions about the readings this week.
