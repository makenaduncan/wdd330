    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>
        I've done a little bit with the transform element but not much. I didn't know you couldn't use 
        it on inline elements. I am really glad the reading talked about putting <u>display: inline-block</u> to fix that. 
        I would have never thought to do that but I know that I will be able to use that on some of my projects.<br><br>
        I didn't realize how many <i>tools</i> worked with the transform element. For example, skew and transitions. I'm also glad that
        the reading pointed out the fact that the order you place these functions in matters. I need to know this stuff or
        I struggle even more. It was also nice to learn more about <i>-webkit</i>. I've seen it when I've googled how to do things
        but I didn't really know what it was or how it worked.

        I like how these chapters discussed the different things I can do with visuals and animations. This 
        went along well with the assignments I am working on for another class and I was even able to use some of the 
        stuff from the readings. It was helpful to learn more about SVG. I have been really confused about it until 
        this reading assignment. <br><br>
        As far as I know, I don't think I've ever used canvas. It seems pretty simple bt I think SVG might be a little 
        easier to use. I also don't like the fact that it operates in immdediate mode. I would probably get frustrated 
        with that because I already struggle with programming. It would be hard to not be able to make changes later.

        I don't have any questions about the readings this week.
