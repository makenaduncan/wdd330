    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <p>
        I mostly just coded the activities for my notes but I did want to remember: <i>window</i> is a global object and makes any global variable created property of it. Not all of the information
        that is returned is reliable. Users can modify it. It's crazy how much information you can collect/retrieve.
