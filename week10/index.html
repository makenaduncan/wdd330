        <p>Validating Forms and Using Fetch</p>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

            The validating forms reading was basically a review for me. I am currently in a class that is all about client and server side validation. 
            I find that client side validation is a lot easier to set up but they are both pretty simple. I forget that you can use css to style it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been using this extension called "noValidate" so that I can test the server side versus client side. That way I can make sure that both
            validation methods are working. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I've used fetch() a lot in my classes. I've always recognized it and known that it is used to retrieve information but I never fully understood
           how it worked. This reading was great for filling in the blanks. 
        </p>

            This week's reading covered one of the few areas of programming I actually understand. This was helpful for refreshing my memory though.

            I don't have any questions this week.
